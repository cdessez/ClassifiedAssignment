====================

This project was a coursework for the postgraduate course "Parallel Algorithm" at the Imperial College London. 

We studied the parallelization of the Inverse Laplace transform and implements it in C++ with MPI and OpenMP.

The code is in implementation/. It may not compile since it the file mystery.o was given to us already compiled for an amd64 architecture.

The directory reverse-engineering/ tried to analyse what the mytery.o given already compiled actually did. (Actually out first task was to understand what we were supposed to do, since the specification was more an enigma / treasure hunt than a well-defined academic question)
